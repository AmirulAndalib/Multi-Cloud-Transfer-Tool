<h1 align="center">Multi Cloud Transfer 🔥</h1>
<p><b>👋 Hello there! Welcome to Multi Cloud Transfer Tool (MCT Tool), a Google Colab based Jupyter Notebook that uses Rclone & other popular engines like yt-dlp, aria, libtorrent and 7Zip etc to manipulate & tranfer data (even simultaneously) between two or more cloud services without utilizing one’s own bandwidth or system resources. Sounds awesome, right? 😎

But wait, there’s more! MCT Tool also saves important user session or configuration files in safe (encrypted) format to make things easier next time when user perform same task requiring same configuration or session files. No need to remember those pesky passwords or settings ever again! 🙌

MCT Tool is powered by Rclone, one of the best command line tool for data transfer & data management. It can transfer any amount of data from/to any cloud service without breaking a sweat 💦. It’s like having your own personal cloud assistant that does all the work for you while you sit back and relax ☕.</b></p>

<h2><b>🪝Multi Cloud Transfer</b></h2>
<p><b>MCT Tool uses Rclone, one of the best command line tool for data transfer & data management tool for performing any task involving transfer of data, that means it can transfer any amount of data from/to any cloud service without utilizing one's own bandwidth or system resources.</b></p>
<h4><b>1.Before we procced! I recommend to either create/upload or fetch your Rclone Config file to Google Colab using below methods! Creating and fetching will automatically place the file in correct location!</b></h4>
<h4><b>Options:</b></h4>
<p><b><code>Custom_Import_Path</code>: Scan a custom path (or directory) given by user for usable MCT Configuration files.</p>
<p><b><code>Custom_Export_Path</code>: Export all your MCT Configuration files to a gives path.</b></p>
<img src="Img/24.png">
<h4><b>2.Once you done creating or fetching the config files! just run the cell named <code>Connect to Cloud Accounts</code> and it will automatically detect your config file and will show you the available remotes, follow on-screen instructions to mount them</b></h4>
<h4><b>Options:</b></h4>
<p><b><code>Custom_Mount_Point</code>: To set Custom Mount Point.</b></p>
<p><b><code>Custom_Cache_Dir</code>: To set Custom Cache Directory.</p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/87380104/185793654-f658a130-c9d3-4fa6-b2e3-e53535b1f99e.png">
<h4><b>3.After mounting those remotes or cloud Accounts, now click on the file icon as shown in the image and then navigate to the folder where you mounted your remoted (default folder is <code>drives</code>) and you will see the names of remotes or cloud account which you mounted previously!</b></h4>
<img src="Img/26.png">
<h4><b>4.Now copy the file or folder path which needs to be copied and then right click on the file or folder and select <code>Copy Path</code> option from the list.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/27.png">
  <h4><b>5.After that! paste the path of file or folder in <code>Source</code> field and again go to <code>File Icon->drives</code> and open the cloud Account into which you want to transfer files/folders and copy its path! You can either directly copy the path of cloud Account or of any folder inside it and paste the path in <code>Destination</code> field.</b></h4>
<img src="Img/28.png">
<h4><b>6.Choose the transfer mode trough which you want to transfer your data! refer to "<a href="#modes-of-transfer">🚅Modes of Transfer</a>" below to learn about all of them.</b></h4>
<h4><b>9.Finally! run the code by pressing play button to initiate transfer.</b></h4>
<h2><b>🪀Using Service Accounts</b></h4>
<h4><b>Service Accounts are just like normal Google Account and thus have same upload or download limits as Google Account which is 750GB upload and 10TB download. They are used to act on behalf of a Google Account and hence we can use them to prevent hitting Google Drive transfer limits by creating them in a bulk amount.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>1.Don't have Service Accounts?<a href="https://github.com/TheCaduceus/CloneBot_V2#-making-service-accounts" alt="Creating SA"> Create Here</a></b></h4>
  <h4><b>2.After creating! make the zip of <code>accounts</code> folder which have 100 Json files and keep its name as <code>accounts.zip</code>.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>3.Now back to Google Colab screen and select saving options for Service Accounts to use them without uploading them again next time.</b></h4>
  <h4><b>Options:</b></h4>
  <p><b><code>Upload_Service_Accounts</code>: Upload new Service Accounts.</b></p>
  <p><b><code>Save_To_MyDrive</code>: Save new/existing Service Accounts to My Drive->MCT Config folder.</b></p>

  <h4><b>4.After it! click the file icon, then open <code>accounts</code> folder and right click on anyone Json file and select <code>Copy path</code>.</b></h4>
  <img src="Img/32.png">
  <h4><b>5.Run the <code>Create/Edit/Delete Rclone Config File</code> and paste the path in <code>service_account_file</code> during creating remote for Google Drive.</b></h4>

<h2><b>🚅Modes of Transfer</b></h2>
<h4><b>As this project use Rclone as a base! and Rclone support multiple options to help you move or clean your Data, in this Project those options are known as Modes. Here is the list of the Modes that this Project supports:</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Copy</code>: Copy files from source to dest, skipping identical files.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Copyto</code>: This can be used to upload single files to other than their current name.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>CopyURL</code>: Download a URL's content and copy it to the destination without saving it in temporary storage.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Move</code>: Moves the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Moveto</code>: If source:path is a file or directory then it moves it to a file or directory named dest:path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Check</code>: Checks the files in the source and destination match. It compares sizes and hashes (MD5 or SHA1) and logs a report of files that don't match. It doesn't alter the source or destination.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Sync</code>: Sync the source to the destination, changing the destination only. Doesn't transfer files that are identical on source and destination, testing by size and modification time or MD5SUM. Destination is updated to match source, including deleting files if necessary (except duplicate objects, see below).</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Bisync</code>: Bisync provides a bidirectional cloud sync solution in rclone. It retains the Path1 and Path2 filesystem listings from the prior run. On each successive run it will:</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Cat</code>: Rclone cat sends any files to standard output.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>CleanUp</code>: Clean up the remote if possible. Empty the trash or delete old file versions. Not supported by all remotes.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>ls</code>: List all the objects in the path with size and path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>lsd</code>: List all directories/containers/buckets in the path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>lsl</code>: List all the objects in the path with size, modification time and path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>test makefile</code>: Make files with random contents and of any size.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>md5sum</code>: Produce an md5sum file for all the objects in the path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>sha1sum</code>: Produce a sha1sum file for all the objects in the path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>size</code>: Return the total size and number of objects in path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>genautocomplete</code>: Output shell completion scripts for rclone.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>gendocs</code>: Output markdown docs for rclone to the directory supplied.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>obscure</code>: Obscure password for use in the rclone.conf.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>tree</code>: List the contents of the remote in a tree like fashion.</b></h4>
  <p><b>Following Modes can easily cause Data Loss:</b></p>
    <h4><b><code>Delete</code>: Remove the files in path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>Purge</code>: Will delete whole Directory and leaving nothing behind.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>rmdir</code>: Completely Delete the given path.</b></h4>
    <h4><b><code>rmdirs</code>: Remove any empty directories under the path.</b></h4>
